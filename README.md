## Film Query Project

For this project, the objective was to create a command-line application that
retrieves and displays film data. It is menu-based, and allows the user to choose
actions and submit query data.


###Objectives

Create a command line application that retrieves & displays film data.
menu-based where a user can look up a film by its ID, search by keyword, or exit.
Users can choose actions & submit film query data
Database access methods decared in the DatabaseAccessor interface, and
implemented in the DatabaseAccessorObject class.

When a user looks up film ID:
They are prompted to enter the film id, and a message if the film is not found.
If film is found, the title, year, rating, and description is displayed.

when the user looks up film by keyword:

#### Lessons Learned

While completing the Film Query application, I learned how to retrieve data from a table using an SQL statement. I also learned how to join information from multiple tables using a join condition.
I think that really understanding how to formulate the SQL was a challenge for me. Through practice and repetition, it is becoming easier to formulate.
The second challenge I came across was really understanding how object relational mapping really works. I understood it in theory, but applying the knowledge to actual code really helped me understand how the data is retrieved.
